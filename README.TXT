PROJECT TITLE: Impulse
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create an awesome game
VERSION or DATE: 01/26/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run greenfoot and follow the instructions in the tutorial world
AUTHORS: Keira, Murtaza, Sameer
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Use w, a, s, d to move. Use 'e' to interact (with trashcans, doors, letters, etc)


In the Demon and EvilBear actor classes, we used a method called "deltaX(int n)" to recursively speed up as the actors. 
The reset button doesn't reset static variables so relaunch the game instead.

Hint: Interact with letters before anything else to learn your objectives
